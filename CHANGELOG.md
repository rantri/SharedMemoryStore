# Changelog

All notable package and documentation changes are recorded in reverse
chronological order.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Zero-copy reservation ingest with `TryReserve`, `ValueReservation`,
  exact-byte `Advance`, atomic `Commit`, `Abort`, and disposal cleanup.
- Segmented `ReadOnlySequence<byte>` publication through `TryPublishSegments`
  without a temporary full-payload array.
- Explicit reservation recovery, appended reservation statuses, layout minor
  version `1`, reservation diagnostics, contract tests, integration tests,
  sample, and benchmarks.

### Compatibility

- Package remains `SharedMemoryStore` targeting `net10.0`.
- Runtime dependencies remain .NET BCL only.
- Existing publish, acquire, lease, remove, diagnostics, and package workflows
  remain compatible.
- Shared-memory layout major version remains `1`; minor version is now `1`.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Initial public package contract for create/open, publish, acquire, release,
  remove, diagnostics, stale lease recovery, and slot reuse.
- Public documentation baseline for evaluators, package consumers, production
  reviewers, future implementers, contributors, and maintainers.
- Root MIT license, support policy, security policy, contribution guide, code of
  conduct, issue templates, pull request template, and release guide.
- Documentation validation for required files, placeholders, internal links,
  package metadata alignment, contract links, contributor paths, and release
  readiness.

### Compatibility

- Package targets `net10.0`.
- Windows x64 named memory-mapped files are the first validated runtime target.
- C++ and Python are future portability audiences; current bindings are not
  included.
- This entry documents a prerelease `0.1.0` baseline and does not imply stable
  `1.0.0` API compatibility.

### Known Limitations

- Runtime support is Windows-first.
- The core store treats values and descriptors as opaque bytes and does not
  parse application-specific frame layouts.
- Public repository URL metadata is left to release preparation because no
  repository remote is configured in this checkout.
